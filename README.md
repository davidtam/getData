Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


The repo contains the work for the course project.

There are the following files:

* [**UCI**](https://github.com/davidtam28/getData/tree/master/UCI) - the directory that contains the original data files, with so unused files stripped out.

* [**run_analysis.R**](https://github.com/davidtam28/getData/blob/master/run_analysis.R) - the actual R code that is used for cleaning up data and convert into required format.

* [**meanBySubjectAndActivity.txt**](https://github.com/davidtam28/getData/blob/master/meanBySubjectAndActivity.txt) - the file contains the "Tidy" data that is submitted as to the course.  [CodeBook for the tidy file can be found here](https://github.com/davidtam28/getData/blob/master/CodeBook.md)
